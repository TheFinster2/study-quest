/* Proof and derivation puzzles for the Proof Builder and the Induction Builder.

   Each puzzle stores its steps IN ORDER. The game shuffles them, so the data
   is the answer key and the validator can assert that a puzzle is solvable in
   exactly `steps.length` moves.

   `traps` are plausible-but-wrong step cards mixed into the pool. They are
   what stops the mode being solvable by elimination once you have placed
   n - 1 cards.

   Induction puzzles additionally carry `phase` labels, which the Induction
   Builder uses to run its four-stage flow: base case, assumption, inductive
   step, conclusion. */
