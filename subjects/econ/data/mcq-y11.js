/* Multiple choice — Preliminary course (P1–P6).

   Two rules that validate.js enforces and that matter more than they look:

   1. Every question carries a `why` for the correct answer AND a one-line
      reason for every distractor. A question that only says "wrong" teaches
      nothing; the reason a wrong answer is tempting is the actual lesson.

   2. Option lengths are balanced. If the correct answer is reliably the
      longest option, a student who knows no economics can score by counting
      characters, and validate.js fails the build when that happens in more
      than about a third of a topic's questions. */

  options:["unemployment rising and inflationary pressure easing","unemployment falling and inflationary pressure building","both unemployment and inflation falling to zero","output growing faster than its long-run trend rate"], answer:0,
  why:"Falling aggregate demand reduces output, so firms shed labour and unemployment rises. With spare capacity appearing, price pressure eases.",

  q:"A government imposes a tax on a good with a strong negative externality. The intended effect is to",
  options:["raise the private cost towards the social cost, reducing output to the optimum","raise revenue without changing consumer or producer behaviour at all","increase supply of the good by compensating the producers for the external damage caused","eliminate the externality entirely by banning production of the good"], answer:0,
  why:"The market fails because the price does not include the external cost. A corrective tax internalises it, shifting supply left so that the quantity traded falls towards the socially optimal level.",

  misconception:"The point of a corrective tax is the behaviour change, not the revenue." }
