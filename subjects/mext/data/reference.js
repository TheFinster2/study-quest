/* The Reference Library — a searchable formula sheet mirroring the NESA
   reference sheet, plus the tables that sheet leaves out (exact values, the
   unit circle, the standard normal table).

   Reading reference material earns nothing. That is deliberate: it should be
   the thing you reach for when stuck, not another XP faucet.

   ── the leading asterisk ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   A row whose FIRST cell starts with "*" is printed on the NESA reference
   sheet — the one you are handed in the exam. Everything else you have to
   carry in your head. The marker lives in the data rather than in a parallel
   array of indices because a parallel array silently rots the moment somebody
   reorders a row, and a wrong "this is printed" flag is worse than no flag:
   it teaches a student not to learn something nobody is going to give them.

   Strip it with MX.Reference.cells(row); test it with MX.Reference.isNesa(row).
   The flat, searchable version of the same information — the one the in-play
   Toolbelt uses — lives in js/data/formulas.js. */
