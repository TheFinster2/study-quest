/* 🪜 Proof Builder — assemble a proof or derivation from shuffled step cards.

   Chemistry built a synthesis route through a reaction graph; this builds an
   argument. Same validation shape: the puzzle declares its own step count and
   the game checks the assembled order against it.

   Two anti-farm details, both from the addendum:

   · C1 — NO PER-ITEM FLOOR, and the completion bonus is gated on EFFICIENCY
     (ideal steps ÷ steps actually spent, wrong placements included). Flailing
     does eventually solve a proof, so "solved it" cannot be what pays.
   · C2 — RESTART CARRIES ITS COST. The obvious exploit is "try everything,
     note what worked, restart, do it cleanly for full marks". So the wasted
     attempts AND the moves already taken are charged to the puzzle before the
     board clears. */
