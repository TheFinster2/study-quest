   ============================================================================
   The router, header, toasts, modals, gameShell and the reward pipeline are the app's
   (SQ.UI). What stays here is what Close Reading's modes call that the app does not
   have: the reading-time model (timeBudget / rushFloor / rushHint), the latching
   crutches, the glossary chips, the Layer C banner, copy-to-clipboard, and English's
   own gated results screen — which opens behind a button so the worked solutions stay
   readable underneath.

   award() is wrapped only to translate English's `crutchCost` (a fraction of the run,
   latched) into the core call; everything else — difficulty × prestige, the accuracy
   gate on the bonus, the ×4 ceiling, the coin rate (0.6), Stars and the overall level —
   happens in SQ.UI.award.

  /* ── how long reading actually takes ─────────────────────────
     Chemistry could use a flat 1,200 ms floor because its stems were one line. English
     cannot: a technique question with a two-line quote and a Marking Desk sample of 180
     words are not the same read, and a single constant is wrong in both directions —
     too low and the mode is farmable, too high and an honest fast reader is punished
     for being quick.

     ~800 ms of orientation plus 240 ms per word ≈ 250 wpm, which is brisk but real for
     a student who already knows the text. Capped, because nobody is made to stare at a
     paragraph for a minute before the app will believe them. Tuned against
     tests/suites/economy.js, which asserts the floor is both real AND reachable — the
     only way to know it has not started punishing normal play. */

  /* ── the anti-farm floor, which is NOT the same number ────────
     readTimeFor above was doing two jobs with opposite requirements, and that was the
     bug behind "I get no XP for rushing even though I read the question".

     Job one is sizing a CLOCK. There it should be generous: give a student long enough
     to read a 180-word paragraph carefully, and let Nightmare cut only the slack above
     it. Too small is the failure.

     Job two is catching somebody TAPPING WITHOUT READING. There it should be tight: the
     question is "could a human possibly have taken this in", not "did they read it at a
     careful pace". Too large is the failure — and too large is what shipped.

     Measured on the real bank: at 240 ms/word over the stem, the quote AND all four
     options, a median Common-Module boss round needed 23.1 seconds before an answer
     scored, against a 26-second clock. That is a 2.9-second window in which XP existed
     at all. Answer at twenty seconds having genuinely read it: nothing. Worse on Hard
     and Nightmare, where the clock shrinks toward the floor and the window closes to
     about 1.6 seconds. Rapid Fire was worse still — 120 seconds for 24 questions is
     ~5 seconds each, so essentially every answer in the mode was scoring zero.

     So the floor is now its own function with its own numbers:

       • 55 ms/word (~1,100 wpm) on the stem and quote — a skim, not a read. This is a
         lower bound on the physically possible, which is what an anti-farm gate needs.
       • 25 ms/word on the OPTIONS, because you scan them and stop at the one you want.
         Charging full reading rate for three distractors you never finished is the
         single biggest source of the old over-estimate.
       • capped at 9 seconds outright, and additionally at 45% of the mode's clock where
         there is one — so a timed mode can never be built in which XP is unreachable.
         That cap is the structural guarantee; the rest is calibration. */
