/* ============================================================================
   THE MARKING STACK — every typed answer in the app goes through here.

   Three layers, in increasing order of softness:

     A  Structural   `===` on a determinate answer. Choices, orderings, matches.
                     The backbone; most of the app.
     B  Fuzzy string Normalised Levenshtein at 0.85, on SINGLE WORDS AND SHORT
                     NAMES ONLY. This is spellcheck, not marking.
     C  Embeddings   Bundled MiniLM, cosine similarity, entirely in-browser.
                     Short analytical claims only — one or two sentences.

   Two rules the rest of the app depends on:

   1. Layer B is never given a sentence. Levenshtein and Jaccard measure surface
      form, so on prose they reward reusing the model answer's words — which is
      exactly the word-for-word marking this app exists not to do. Two excellent
      analytical sentences can share no vocabulary at all. Sentences go to Layer C
      or to a structural mode; there is no third path.

   2. `"unavailable"` is a first-class verdict, not an error. Layer C cannot run
      from file:// (WASM and workers are CORS-blocked there) and cannot run before
      the model has been downloaded. Callers show the exemplars, award nothing, and
      say so plainly.

   No network request is ever made. The runtime and the weights are vendored into
   the repo; transformers.js is explicitly configured not to phone home, and
   tests/suites/offline.js fails the build if anything reaches outward.

     The original rule was: cosine over threshold or nothing, with any near-miss within
     0.02 of the best exemplar vetoing the answer outright. Two things were wrong with
     that, and both showed up as "I gave a decent answer and it was scrapped".

     One: near-misses are TOPICALLY IDENTICAL to the exemplars by construction — they are
     the same idea read badly. So a good answer sits close to both, and a 0.02 margin
     rejected answers for being about the right subject. The veto now needs the wrong
     reading to be clearly nearer (NEAR_MISS_MARGIN), and a strongly-scoring answer
     survives it as "close" rather than being thrown away.

     Two: a single pass/fail on one number is neither honest nor useful. A student who
     made the point but never said what the technique does has done something different
     from one who wrote nothing, and telling them apart is the whole job. So the result
     carries a mark out of four, built from four NAMED criteria — and three of them are
     deterministic, so when a mark is lost the app can say exactly why and be right.

       Point    0–2   does it answer the question?      ← the embedding, the only fuzzy part
       Detail   0–1   is the text actually in it?       ← technique named, or the words quoted
       Effect   0–1   does it say what that DOES?       ← an analytical verb, not a plot verb

     This is not a cosine dressed up as a mark. Two of the four marks cannot move without
     the student's words changing in a way you could point at, and the criteria are the
     ones a marker would use. What is never shown is the similarity number itself (§12).  */

  /* A near-miss must beat the best exemplar by this much before it costs anything.
     MEASURED, not guessed: at the original 0.02 it fired on four of eight hand-labelled
     good answers, because a good answer and a bad reading of the same idea share their
     whole vocabulary. Even at this margin it still fires on some good answers — MiniLM is
     384 dimensions and cannot always tell them apart — so it now costs ONE MARK rather
     than the answer. That is the difference between "you have drifted" and "start again". */
  const NEAR_MISS_MARGIN = 0.045;
  const MAX_MARK = 4;

  /* FULL MARKS need the best exemplar to beat the nearest wrong reading by this much.
     This is the fix for the real problem the calibration set exposed, which no threshold
     alone can solve: on 49 hand-labelled responses, good answers span 0.396–0.906 cosine
     and wrong ones span 0.113–0.979. The distributions OVERLAP — 384 dimensions cannot
     separate "made the point" from "misread it" on absolute similarity, and pretending
     otherwise is how a threshold ends up punishing whoever writes best.

     So the threshold is set low enough that no good answer is scrapped, and the fourth mark
     is gated on the CONTRAST instead. A wrong answer sits close to its own near-miss by
     construction, because a near-miss IS the misreading; a good answer does not. Measured:
     the old arrangement scrapped four good answers and let none through; this one scraps
     none and lets one thin answer reach full marks, which is the better trade because a
     false pass still shows the student every model answer. */

     adequate one-clause answers hit 0.64 and 0.75. Marking on absolute cosine therefore
     penalises exactly the students who write best, which is why Point is worth two of
