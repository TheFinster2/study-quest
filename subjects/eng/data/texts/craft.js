/* The Craft of Writing — Module C. A skills focus, not a prescribed text.
   ============================================================================
   Module C is examined on what you can DO and on whether you can account for it, so
   this file is built differently from the others: the `context` array holds craft
   principles rather than historical facts, and the `quotes` array holds short model
   sentences written for this app — each one a single technique doing a single job,
   labelled as a model rather than passed off as literature.

   Where a real author is quoted, it is a short public-domain extract and it is
   attributed. Nothing here pretends a demonstration sentence is a published one.

  blurb: "No prescribed text. Three forms, one reflection statement, and a small number " +
         "of moves you can actually practise: how a sentence starts, where it puts its " +
         "weight, and what it declines to say.",

  context: [
    { fact: "Module C asks for imaginative, discursive or persuasive writing, plus a reflection statement accounting for your choices.",
      why: "The reflection is not an add-on. Marks come from being able to name what you did and why, so a beautiful piece with a vague reflection scores below a competent piece with a precise one." },
    { fact: "Discursive writing explores an idea from several angles without committing to a single thesis.",
      why: "It is the form most often written badly, because students turn it into a persuasive essay with hedging. A discursive piece is allowed to change its mind on the page — that movement is the form." },
    { fact: "Persuasive writing has a position and pursues it; imaginative writing creates a world.",
      why: "The three forms are distinguished by intent, not by decoration. An imaginative piece with a moral tacked on the end has usually become a bad persuasive one." },
    { fact: "The reflection statement should quote your own writing.",
      why: "Naming a technique without pointing at the words is the same weakness as an essay asserting a technique without quoting the text. Markers want the evidence in both directions." },
    { fact: "A stimulus in the exam must be used, not merely mentioned.",
      why: "The commonest Module C failure is a piece that gestures at the stimulus in its first line and then ignores it. The stimulus should be load-bearing." },
    { fact: "Sentence length is a technique, not an accident.",
      why: "A short sentence after three long ones lands because of the contrast. Rhythm is the most controllable variable in prose and the least often deliberately used." },
    { fact: "Specificity outperforms intensity.",
      why: "'A dog barked somewhere' is weaker than 'the neighbour's kelpie started up again'. Concrete nouns do the work that adjectives are usually recruited for." },
    { fact: "Voice is created by what a narrator notices, not by how ornate the prose is.",
      why: "Selection is characterisation. Two narrators in the same room describing different objects have told you everything about themselves before either has spoken." },
    { fact: "The most common structural fault in student imaginative writing is a twist ending.",
      why: "A twist retroactively cancels the reader's investment. Endings that pay off something planted early are almost always stronger and are far easier to reflect on." },
    { fact: "Deliberate imitation of a studied writer is a legitimate Module C strategy.",
      why: "Borrowing Woolf's sentence rhythm or Orwell's plainness is craft, provided the reflection names the debt. Unacknowledged imitation reads as pastiche." }

  characters: [
    { name: "The persona", role: "constructed voice",
      note: "Not you. Deciding how much the narrator knows, and how much they will admit, is the first craft decision in any piece.",
      concepts: ["voice","persona","craft"] },
    { name: "The implied reader", role: "audience",
      note: "Every piece assumes someone. A discursive essay that assumes a hostile reader argues differently from one that assumes a curious one.",

  ],

  structure: [
    { feature: "Discursive movement", detail: "An idea approached from several positions, often via anecdote, digression and qualification.",
      why: "The structure is exploratory rather than cumulative. Signposting like 'firstly' actively damages it — the joins should feel like thinking, not like an outline." },
    { feature: "Persuasive architecture", detail: "Position, strongest ground, concession, refutation, return.",
      why: "The concession is what separates persuasion from assertion. Naming the best version of the other side and answering it is the move that buys credibility." },
    { feature: "Imaginative shape", detail: "A situation, a pressure, a change, and something planted early that pays off late.",
      why: "It is not the same as plot. A short piece rarely has room for events, so the change is usually in what the narrator can now see." },
    { feature: "The reflection statement", detail: "What you chose, why, what it was modelled on, and what you cut.",
      why: "'What I cut' is the most under-used sentence in reflections and the most convincing: it proves the choices were choices." },
    { feature: "In medias res opening", detail: "Begin after the beginning.",
      why: "It forces the reader to reconstruct, which is engagement. It also saves the two hundred words of setup that most student pieces spend on arriving somewhere." },
    { feature: "Circular closure", detail: "Return to the opening image with the meaning changed.",
      why: "The most reliable ending available in 800 words, because the reader supplies the significance themselves and it feels earned rather than announced." },
    { feature: "Withheld information", detail: "Let the reader know something before the narrator does, or after.",
      why: "Both gaps generate meaning. Dramatic irony and delayed revelation are the same technique aimed in opposite directions." }
