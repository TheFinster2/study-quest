/* The Shop: power-ups, supply crates, and the arcade's ticket prices.
   StudyQuest: power-ups are sold app-wide (Stars) and the inventory is shared, so the
   `powerups` list below is only the in-run power-up bar's vocabulary. English's
   "adrenaline" (double XP) is the shared `double`. Crates are still bought with Marks in
   the English shop; the arcade (and its tickets) is the app's — kept for reference.
   Marks (✒️) are deliberately scarce — award() pays coins at 60% — so everything here
   costs something. tests/suites/economy.js prints the effort-per-purchase table if it ever
   needs retuning. */
