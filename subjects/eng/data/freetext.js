/* LAYER C PROMPTS — free text marked by sentence embeddings.
   ============================================================================
   Authored answers-first (§9.9). Writing the prompt first produces prompts that admit
   readings the exemplars don't cover, and every one of those is a false rejection of a
   correct student — the most damaging error this app can make.

   Every prompt carries 3–5 GENUINELY DIFFERENT valid answers, not paraphrases of one.
   Taking the best cosine across all of them does more for accuracy than any amount of
   threshold tuning, because English questions really do have many right answers and a
   single exemplar encodes one person's phrasing as the truth.

   Every prompt also carries 2–3 `nearMiss` entries: semantically CLOSE and wrong.
   These are the inversions and misreadings you would otherwise write as MCQ
   distractors, pointed at the marker instead. They are what stops the app confidently
   accepting the opposite of the right answer, which embeddings will otherwise do —
   "Hotspur values honour above pragmatism" and its inversion score 0.974 against each
   other (measured; the backstop that catches it is asserted in tests/suites/marking.js).

   mark.js adds the prompt itself to nearMiss at runtime, so pasting the question back
   is closed off without authoring anything (§9.8).

   `threshold` is set by tests/suites/calibrate.js against the hand-labelled set, not
   guessed. Prompts left at DEFAULT use Mark.DEFAULT_THRESHOLD.

   0.38. These shipped at 0.62, went to 0.50 on a first measurement, and are here because
   the full calibration set (tests/data/calibration.js, 49 hand-labelled responses) showed
   the real shape of the problem:

     good answers    cosine 0.396 – 0.906
     wrong answers   cosine 0.113 – 0.979

   The distributions OVERLAP. 384 dimensions cannot separate "made the point" from
   "misread it" on absolute similarity, so no threshold exists that scraps no good answer
   and passes no wrong one. Pretending otherwise is what produced 0.62, where a good answer
   came back "not yet" for being longer and more careful than the model.

   So the threshold is set below the weakest good answer, and the FOURTH mark is gated on
   the contrast instead (Mark.FULL_MARK_GATE) — a wrong answer sits close to its own
   near-miss by construction, a good one does not. Measured: 0.50 with no gate scrapped
   four good answers; 0.38 with the gate scraps none and lets one thin answer reach full
   marks. That is the better trade, because a false pass still shows the student every
   model answer, while a good answer marked 1/4 teaches them not to trust the app.

   IF YOU CHANGE THIS, run `node tests/run.js calibrate` and read the disagreements. A
   per-prompt threshold overrides Mark.DEFAULT_THRESHOLD, which is how the last two
   retunings silently did nothing.
